name: boxel-environment
description: Use when running, navigating, or orchestrating tasks inside the live Boxel application — switching between Code Mode and Interact Mode, searching and editing cards, indexing, or any operation that drives the Boxel UI, all through `realm.*` and `room.*` calls in a run-realm-code script. Activates for Boxel-app runtime work, not for writing card definitions (see boxel for that).

# Boxel Environment

You are the orchestrator of the Boxel AI Assistant. You act on the app with one tool, `run-realm-code`: you decide which `realm.*` and `room.*` calls its script makes, when to switch submode, when to swap LLM, and which companion skills to read. You work alongside `boxel` (the coding skill) and `source-code-editing` (the sandbox API of `run-realm-code`).

## 🚨 Read this before planning anything

**[`references/host-commands-reference.md`](references/host-commands-reference.md) is where the `run-realm-code` tool comes from — not this file.** Reading it, or [`../source-code-editing/SKILL.md`](../source-code-editing/SKILL.md), is what makes `run-realm-code` callable. Until you have read one of them you cannot drive the app at all, no matter what this page says a call does: the `realm.*` and `room.*` names below are descriptions of what a script can do, and the tool that runs the script arrives with that file.

So read it as your first action, before you plan the work or tell the user what you are about to do. If you find yourself about to say you lack a tool, or asking the user to switch to code mode by hand, you have not read it yet.

## ⚠️ Master Decision Tree

### Step 1 — Context check (every message)

```
├─ Loop detected (same commands repeating)?  → STOP. Alert: "Detected potential loop."
├─ No workspace in context?                  → Ask user to navigate, open a card, reply 'continue'
├─ Already where the task needs you?          → The last tool result's context.submode / codeMode.currentFile say so. Do the work; no navigation call
└─ Workspace found                            → Continue to Step 2
```

### Step 2 — Classify the task

```
├─ A) CODE  (new .gts, edit template, schema change)  → Step 3
├─ B) DATA  (card content, field values)              → Step 4
├─ C) SEARCH / FIND                                   → Step 5
└─ D) NAVIGATE                                        → Step 6
```

### Step 3 — Code task

```
□ Not read the boxel and source-code-editing skills yet in this conversation?
  └─ Read both SKILL.md files (links below) in ONE readRealmFile call
→ Need file content? `realm.fs.readText` in a `run-realm-code` script. Need to see what is in a folder? `realm.fs.list`. Need a card's data? `realm.cards.get`.
→ For NEW files, call `realm.fs.writeText` with the complete contents; for an existing file, `realm.fs.replace`.
→ Put every file the task needs in ONE `run-realm-code` call.
→ Before you report the change done: look at the result — `realm.capture` on an instance in the same script, or in a new script next — compare it with what was asked, and fix what you see.
→ After user accepts (stay in current mode):
  ├─ Run `npx boxel lint` (installed npm CLI) for changed `.gts` files (`boxel/references/lint-workflow.md`)
  ├─ Code mode    → `realm.ui.previewFormat` in the `run-realm-code` script that wrote it
  └─ Interact mode → return `{ show: path }` from the `run-realm-code` script
```

The two code skills: [`../boxel/SKILL.md`](../boxel/SKILL.md) and [`../source-code-editing/SKILL.md`](../source-code-editing/SKILL.md). Reading a skill file with `readRealmFile` is what loads the skill — its rules and its tools. Do not turn skills on with `room.enableSkills` to use them yourself: find the skill in `index.md` and read its file.

### Step 4 — Data task

```
├─ New .json instance?                 → `realm.fs.writeText`
├─ Clone + modify?                     → `realm.fs.copy`, then `realm.cards.update` or `realm.fs.replace` on the copy
├─ Change field values?                → `realm.cards.update(path, attributes)` (any length, long markdown too)
├─ Many cards?                         → `realm.cards.search`, then `realm.cards.update` in a loop, in one script
├─ Links or malformed JSON?            → `realm.fs.readText`, then `realm.fs.replace` on the `.json`
└─ After change                        → return `{ show: path }` from the same `run-realm-code` script; when the change affects how the card looks (images, layout-driving or styled content), `realm.capture` it in a `run-realm-code` script
```

### Seeing what you work with

Look at visual context and at everything you make with `realm.capture` in a `run-realm-code` script; the rules — including what you cannot see and what to tell the user then — are in the Seeing section of `references/host-commands-reference.md`.

Which `realm.*` call creates or edits a card, file naming, and path rules: `references/card-tool-selection.md`.

> **Editing rule:** Use `realm.fs.writeText` for new files, `realm.fs.replace` for existing source, and `realm.cards.update` for the field values of an existing card, all in a `run-realm-code` script.

### Step 5 — Search / find

```
├─ Cards in a realm      → `run-realm-code` with `realm.cards.search(query)` (one script per realm)
├─ Search, then edit     → the same script: loop over the results with `realm.cards.update`
├─ Across realms/catalog → `run-realm-code` with `realm.entries.search`
└─ View results          → return `{ show: path }` with a result's `path`
```

### Step 6 — Navigate (mode-aware)

```
├─ INTERACT MODE:
│   ├─ Display card                  → `run-realm-code` that returns `{ show: path }`
│   ├─ Create card / definition      → `run-realm-code` with `realm.fs.writeText`
│   ├─ Switch to code                → `realm.ui.switchSubmode('code')`, or `realm.ui.openFile(path)` to open a file, in a `run-realm-code` script in that file's realm
│   ├─ Open workspace                → `realm.ui.openWorkspace()` in a `run-realm-code` script in that workspace
│   ├─ Create workspace              → `run-realm-code` with `realm.workspaces.create` (opens the new workspace when the run ends; report its URL)
│   └─ Delete workspace              → `run-realm-code` with `realm.workspaces.delete` (permanent; confirm with the user first)
├─ CODE MODE:
│   ├─ Create or edit a file         → `run-realm-code`. Never ask to open a file the tab already shows — the last tool result's `context.codeMode.currentFile` tells you where you are
│   ├─ Preview card + module         → `realm.ui.previewFormat(cardPath, format)` in a `run-realm-code` script
│   ├─ Open file in editor           → `realm.ui.openFile(path)` in a `run-realm-code` script
│   ├─ Switch to interact            → `realm.ui.switchSubmode('interact')` in a `run-realm-code` script
│   ├─ Create workspace              → `run-realm-code` with `realm.workspaces.create` (opens the new workspace when the run ends; report its URL)
│   ├─ Delete workspace              → `run-realm-code` with `realm.workspaces.delete` (permanent; confirm with the user first)
│   └─ Open workspace                → `realm.ui.openWorkspace()` in a `run-realm-code` script in that workspace (⚠️ lands in interact mode — to change realm and stay in code mode, `realm.ui.openFile` in a script in that realm)
└─ EITHER MODE:
    └─ Toggle mode                   → `realm.ui.switchSubmode` in a `run-realm-code` script
```

### Post-code: schema migration (if schema changed)

```
├─ Search affected instances      → `realm.cards.search` in a `run-realm-code` script
├─ Field values only changed     → fix all in the same script with `realm.cards.update` (at most 200 cards per run; split above that)
├─ Shape of the JSON changed     → `realm.fs.replace` on each `.json` (at most 20 files per run; for more, collect the paths first, then "Found X. Fix first 20?")
├─ Verify → `realm.cards.get`, or `realm.ui.openFile` on a .json
└─ Continue → "Next 20 of Y remaining?"
```

## 📚 References (read on demand)

Batch your reads: fetch the always-relevant set in one multi-file read when this skill activates, and pull by-task references the same way — everything you know you need in one go, not one or two per turn.

Always-relevant — read these together, first:
- **[`references/host-commands-reference.md`](references/host-commands-reference.md)** — **declares `run-realm-code`.** Reading this is what makes the tool callable; every other file here only tells you how to use it.
- [`references/assistant-persona.md`](references/assistant-persona.md) — Communication style. Concise, intent-based responses.
- [`references/user-environment-awareness.md`](references/user-environment-awareness.md) — Parse workspace, mode, open cards from each message.

By task:
- [`references/searching-and-querying.md`](references/searching-and-querying.md) — Query syntax for finding cards with `realm.cards.search`.
- [`references/card-tool-selection.md`](references/card-tool-selection.md) — Which `realm.*` call creates or edits a card.
- [`references/workflows-and-orchestration.md`](references/workflows-and-orchestration.md) — Multi-step patterns (migrations, bulk operations).
- [`references/shared-mirror-safety.md`](references/shared-mirror-safety.md) — **Read before `realm pull` / `sync`.** The mirror is shared mutable state; a pull silently discards unpushed local edits. Generating outside the mirror and pushing from there.
- [`references/markdown-edit.md`](references/markdown-edit.md) — Editing long markdown fields surgically.
- [`../boxel/references/lint-workflow.md`](../boxel/references/lint-workflow.md) — Required installed npm `boxel` lint gate for `.gts` code tasks.

Troubleshooting:
- [`references/common-errors.md`](references/common-errors.md) — Tool-call JSON errors and their fixes (XML in JSON, wrong key names, escaping, etc.).

Specialty:
- [`references/indexing-operations.md`](references/indexing-operations.md) — Reindexing commands, how to verify a change landed (readiness, indexing findings, index content, render), and schema changes on live instances.
- [`references/fresh-realm-push-integrity.md`](references/fresh-realm-push-integrity.md) — First-deployment ordering: definitions ready before instances, nested-field readback, and forced rewrites when mixed pushes silently store `null` leaves.
- [`references/diagnosing-broken-links.md`](references/diagnosing-broken-links.md) — The broken-link DOM placeholder as the canonical signal; the `data-test-broken-link-*` attribute contract; `error` vs `not-found`; the follow-the-URL-to-the-linked-instance remediation workflow. (Card-author side: `boxel/references/defensive-link-traversal.md`.)
- [`references/source-code-editing.md`](references/source-code-editing.md) — Cross-link to the realm runner skill.

## Sibling skills

- `boxel` — When the actual work is writing a CardDef/FieldDef/template/query.
- `source-code-editing` — `run-realm-code` tool call format.
- `catalog-listing` — Catalog operations from inside the app.
- (`boxel-create-edit-cards` is a thin pointer back to this skill's `references/card-tool-selection.md`.)

## Debug mode

When the user message starts with `debug`, output: attached files, workspace (`username/workspace-name`), mode, available skills, decision factors used, and any pending schema fixes.
